# Drawing-pictures-with-patterns
this project is about ‘drawing’ 24*24-pixel 
binary images using 7 different patterns. The program is written in C programming 
language, the images were found on the Internet and processes using Python 
programming language, to get the size and format as needed. The goal was to achieve 
the best possible patterns, which were created randomly, to represent 5 different binary 
images opened by the user. The method of getting the best possible patterns was Genetic 
Algorithms, which as can be understood by the name, mutates or creates new better 
offsprings by the first initial 7 patterns. At the end of the mutation and the best & average 
losses were computed, the original image was recreated using these newly created 
patterns and displayed against the original image for the user to distinguish between 
them.
